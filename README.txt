This directory includes:

1. Code
2. Data

The Data directory contains choice data for the HGF and behavioral and social data for the analysis:

Data
 1. HGF - contains choice data for each period of the pandemic
 2. Figure1_boxplot_data.xlsx - data used to plot Figure 1 boxplots; reversals achieved and points earned data can be found in (11)
 3. Figure2A_confirmed_cases.csv - data used to overlay line graph representing covid cases across the pandemic period
 4. Figure4A_mapData.csv - data used to put together the mask-policy map
 5. Figure4B_protest.csv - data used to put together protest plot
 6. Figure4c_dynata.csv - data used to measure mask-wearing belief
 7. Figure5_CTL.csv - data used to match CTL feature in regression
 8. Figure5_regression.csv - data used to match for regression
 9. Figure5_us_cases_deaths.csv - data used to add confirmed covid cases feature into regression
 10. Figure7_pandemic_cloudresearch.csv - data used to put together the top maps representing CloudResearch recruitment
 11. pandemic.csv - main file containing behavioral data of N=605 individuals recruited during the pandemic period
 12. pandemic.xlsx - same as (9) but includes 'key' tab to elucidate demographic coding
 13. replication.csv - main file containing behavioral data of N=405 individuals recruited for the replication study
 14. us-employment.csv - file used to calculate the statistics for us-employment

*NOTE: (11) & (13) are the main files that also contain HGF belief data. Also, (11) and (13) contain the data for reproducing 
       Figures 3/6 and Figure 8, respectively.
 
 
MATERIALS

The Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF) toolbox v5.3.1 is freely available for download in the TAPAS package at https://translationalneuromodeling.github.io/tapas. We installed and ran the package in MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release 2016a (MathWorks, Natick, MA).
